# go-obsmonster

`go-obsmonster` is a Go-based repository designed to explore and implement best practices in observability. It focuses on the **Top-5 Rule**, which includes the top 5 popular tools and frameworks for logs, metrics, and tracing, as well as the top 5 API CRUD decisions (e.g., HTTP, gRPC). The goal is to collect, observe, and experiment with these tools and practices to understand their strengths and weaknesses.
